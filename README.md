# Beijing 2022 Data Repository

To get to the CSVs, go to the Output Folder, then click on the Folder that has the data for the spot you want. The raw JSON Files are there too because there is more data that exists in there that I just didn't want to pull out at this time. Feel free to explore that more or just use the CSVs or whatever you feel. Eventually, I intend to have this all wrapped up nicely into a package but we'll see if that ever happens. Same with if I decide to dig into the JSON files any more.
