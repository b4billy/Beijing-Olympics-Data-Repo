# Beijing Olympics Data Repo

Definitely still a work in progress. For those that have this link, here is what you need to know:

sportID 113 is hockey and sportID 212 is curling. That is what the name of the folders represents. Alyssa Longmuir has code that can parse the hockey a bit linked below. Haven't began parsing curling, but from experience working with the other parts of this API, it should be very very similar if not the exact same. I work with the NC State WBB team and it is March Madness so I have not and will not get to this for a bit, potentially not even until the summer but the data should all be there... somewhere. All games are identified by their tournament (Men/Women/Mixed Double) and the matchID which I admit is not the best but hey, I tried. These are the only two sports I have for now, still digging for the equivalents of matchIDs for the other sports. It's set up differently because events like bobsled isn't played in a round robin format, it's just 'let everyone compete and then best score wins' so that's saved differently in the API. Eventually I want to make this a package wrapped all pretty and stuff and be a hero, but for now this'll do.

I would really prefer to keep this on the down low for a while until I get all of the Olympics Data. Thanks. - Billy
